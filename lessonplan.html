  <h1>Lesson Plan<br>Rapid Redirections</h1>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>This week’s lesson covers Redirections. We will explore the concept of redirecting a strike. This will build on our Blocking techniques as students now have the choice between the two. Our primary objectives are to understand the use and applications of redirections, and to be able to perform them in lieu of a block or evasion.</p>

    <p><strong>Redirections:</strong> A redirection moves an oncoming strike out of the way. Instead of “bumping” it back with a block, it guides the strike outside of its intended target. This concept emphasizes protection and energy conservation. By lightly pushing, scooping, or slapping, an incoming strike can effortlessly be moved out of the way. The result leaves more control and less effort to the defender, a favorable result. Most redirections work best on direct attacks, though they can be used on all kinds of strikes.</p>

    <h2>Drills</h2>
    <p><strong>Redirections:</strong> The instructor will first go over different kinds of redirections. Students are encouraged to be creative and think on their feet. Efficiency is key. Students will be free to raise their hand and suggest their ideas while the teacher explains. For example, a direct hand strike, like a punch, can be dealt with in a number of ways. There are more than one right answer. The instructor will call on a good listener to come to the front and help demonstrate. The student will do a punch in “slow-mo” so that the technique can be shown clearly. After going over the moves, the students will learn to incorporate them in their regular defense.</p>

    <p>Students will learn the following simple redirections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Slap</strong> – Slaps a direct kick or punch to the outside of the body.</li>
      <li><strong>Scoop</strong> – A brief thumbless hold that lifts up before letting go. Used to throw a kicking opponent off balance while causing them to miss.</li>
      <li><strong>Push</strong> – Works similar to a slap, but instead of quickly hitting a lighter attack out of the way, it is done stronger to knock an opponent off balance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All redirections give the defender more time to plan their next move. They are also an excellent way to protect oneself without the hard impacts of blocking or the energy consumption of evasions. When combined with evasions, though, a defender can accomplish several things at once. The instructor will provide a few unique (and complex) examples for the class to consider. The depth and sheer amount of outcomes in self-defense is not unlike chess. Students will be explained when a redirection should be used, and when it is better to resort to blocking (such as being backed into a corner). Understanding which technique to use will take repetition in future lessons. However, when it finally clicks is when the student will have intuitive self-defense skills.</p>

    <p><strong>Partnered Redirections:</strong> In classes with older students they will pair up. Otherwise, they will line up in a semicircle and the instructor will come around to work with them individually. For this drill, the attacker will lightly extend their arms to simulate punches, allowing for the defender to practice redirecting them. When the pair feels comfortable they can increase the speed. Finally, the pair can switch roles.</p>

    <h2>Games</h2>
    <p><strong>Last One in Gets the Win:</strong> To make things more interesting, we will play a game with our redirections. Each student will get in a line and have to perform a redirection against the blocker. The instructor will lightly swing or push the blocker towards the student, who can use any redirection that feels “natural.” If the student fails to redirect the strike and is hit then they are out. As there are fewer students in the line, the game speeds up and gets more challenging. This is a great muscle memory and reflex exercise. The last one standing is the winner.</p>

    <h2>Words of Wisdom</h2>
    <p>This lesson is all about moving oncoming strikes out of the way, rather than meeting them with blocks or other techniques. Sometimes, the smartest choice is not to meet conflict head on, but to skillfully steer it out of the way. Redirecting in martial arts, and in life, is all about choosing your battles and deciding when it’s best to avoid a collision.</p>

    <h2>At-Home Challenge of the Week</h2>
    <p><strong>Mirror Moves:</strong> At home, in front of a mirror, students can practice their redirections for a few minutes at a time. The trick here is to watch their own hands/arms to help self-correction. When they feel they have done a good amount of review and practice, they may be ready for the bonding idea below.</p>

    <h2>Parent-Child Bonding Idea</h2>
    <p><strong>Guardian and the Gladiator:</strong> An excellent way for parents to engage with their children and reinforce the skills learned in the Redirections lesson.</p>
    <p><strong>How to Play:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Roles:</strong> The child takes on the role of the "Gladiator", a skilled defender, while the parent assumes the role of the "Guardian", a gentle challenger.</li>
      <li><strong>Setup:</strong> The Guardian attempts light, controlled "attacks" towards the Gladiator, simulating various angles and speeds.</li>
      <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The Gladiator's task is to use the redirection techniques learned in class to gently steer these attacks away. The focus should be on fluidity, accuracy, and using minimal force.</li>
      <li><strong>Feedback Loop:</strong> After each redirection, the Guardian provides positive feedback, pointing out what the Gladiator did well and where they can improve.</li>
      <li><strong>Switch Roles:</strong> To add more fun and learning, switch roles. Let the child be the Guardian, and the parent becomes the Gladiator. This allows the child to understand both perspectives.</li>
    </ul>
