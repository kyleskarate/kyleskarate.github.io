<h1>Lesson Plan: Better Blocks</h1>
<p class="updated">Updated: October 28, 2025</p>

<section>
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <p>This week focuses on blocks. Students will practice the four fundamental blocks — High, Middle, Low, and Shin — and learn variations such as Upper Middle, Lower Middle, Wing, and Wall Blocks. We'll also discuss Active vs. Static blocking and reinforce the importance of keeping guards up at all times.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Drills</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Naming The Blocks:</strong> Students repeat each block with its name to reinforce memorization.</li>
    <li><strong>Kick and Block:</strong> Students kick while reacting to a simulated strike, training multitasking and guard retention.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Games</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Last One In Gets The Win:</strong> Elimination game emphasizing fast and accurate blocking.</li>
    <li><strong>The Shark Game:</strong> Students avoid the low “shark” blocker to work on balance and reaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Blocking Deflection:</strong> Students use blocks to deflect soft cones or targets thrown toward them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Words of Wisdom</h2>
  <p>A well-executed block is not merely defense—it’s the first step toward control. In life, as in karate, success often comes from anticipation and timely response rather than brute force.</p>

  <h2>Parent-Child Bonding Idea</h2>
  <p><strong>Block With Me:</strong> Use gentle open-palm strikes (or a pool noodle) to simulate attacks while your child practices blocking. Adjust speed to their skill level and switch roles for fun.</p>
